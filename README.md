# Library_catalog
A virtual Library Catalog that lets a user browse through various sections (Eg. Novels, Newspapers) and subsections (Eg. Fiction/Non-Fiction) so as to help the user navigate to his/her desired article. The admin can create/delete or alter the sections/sub-sections/books inside the catalog as required.
